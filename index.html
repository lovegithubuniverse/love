                                    The first time I saw you, I never thought it would come to this and that I would be writing a letter to you in such an emotional state. It was a good time and now I feel lucky to have met you, such an amazing person. I still remember the dance you did and believe me it was really good. It was very bold of you to find my ID and message me on Instagram but, I am glad you did. 
                                    </p>
            
                                    <p>
                                    I wasn't sure how should I proceed so I thought to keep it light and went anyway with the flow. To be honest, I really liked talking to you. There was always a certain confident and a happy vibe coming from you that I didn't find anywhere. Talking to you was like a dose of energy drink that would lift my energy levels up. Talking to you was good. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <P>
                                        Moving on, these text conversations turned into phone calls. I liked how we talked to each other scared of our families but did anyway. Talking to you, I felt a certain warmness inside. I wasn't able to hide my smiles and laughter even though we were far away from each other. The connection was special, amazing and I dare say, destiny.
                                    </P>

I just thought it wasn't the right time yet to take things forward and hence said nothing, enjoying the beautiful time together. But I always thought that you felt the same way as I did.

I never imagined that I would truly find a person who I would want to spend so much time with, who could truly touch my heart the way you have without even trying. This is not just talk, it comes from the heart. The more I kept knowing you, the more I kept falling for you. I always felt that you were just a second version of me.

Was it because of your family, was it because of examination stress, I don't know you started behaving weirdly and when I tried to confront you, It was a lot of times that we'd end up fighting. I hated fighting with you. I tried to resolve your problem which I never found.

                                        Whatever the case would be, you continue to stay in my life and in my heart. You will stay there forever. It's too much for me to let you walk away. Though I know, that you now know that I am serious for you, but I never expressed my feelings for you. I don't want to live my life with the regret of not expressing my feeling for my beloved. So, I'll do it now.

Everyday I think about you I feel love and inspiration. If I was spelling out my favourite person right now it'd be S-I-M-A-R. Even though you might repeatedly say, I am not beautiful you'll find a lot better girl than me, believe me sometimes I can't stop looking at your photo, you look so damn good. I still remember each and everything of how you were dressed in the wedding. You looked gorgeous. I feel such powerful adoration for you and only you.

Family, friends, what would the society say? bla bla bla. But, believe me you were really brave the day you messaged me and I have faith in you that you are really brave even today. You are one of the strongest people I know. Just open your heart, I know there is society pressure but leave it. Anyways, you are migrating to Canada, no one cares then.

I don't know what will happen in the future. But, I know that in my present, I want to be with you. Enjoy the peaceful loving moments with you. I am not boasting, but it's true that you might never ever find a guy like me. So, please think about it once.
